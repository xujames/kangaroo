# temp

## Project Setup

temp uses yarn for dependency management, webpack for JavaScript compilation, and gulp for task orchestration.

```
# install dependencies
yarn
```

You will also need to set up a `.env` file in the root of the project. Copy and paste the following, and replace with your own credentials and theme ID:

```
URL=temp.myshopify.com
PASSWORD=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
THEME_ID=XXXXXXXXXXX
```
